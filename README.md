# EAD-XML-Conversion-Scripts-Cross-Platform

This repository is based on another repository called [EAD-XML-Conversion-Scripts](https://github.com/RWTTU/EAD-XML-Conversion-Scripts), which was originally written in PowerShell and was limited to use on Windows machines only. The aim of this repository is to provide a cross-platform solution by rewriting the **NewEADXMLCreationScript** in Python.

The Python script has been compiled into an exe file using `pyinstaller`, making it executable on Windows machines without requiring a Python installation. However, the source files can be used on any platform with Python installed. The script can also be run without being compiled into a binary on any system running Python 3.8 or later.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/username/EAD-XML-Conversion-Scripts-Python/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a desired location.

## Usage

1. Double-click `EAD-XML-Conversion-Scripts.exe` to execute the script.

Note: For non-Windows platforms, Python 3.8 or later needs to be installed.
